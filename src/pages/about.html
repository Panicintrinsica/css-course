        <h1>Our History: From Museum Halls to Police Headquarters</h1>
        <p>The Raccoon City Police Department has a long and proud history of service. Established to meet the needs of a growing community, the department has evolved over the decades, always maintaining its core commitment to the safety and security of Raccoon City's residents. In 1969, recognizing the need for a more centralized and spacious facility, the city government acquired the former Raccoon City Museum building to serve as the new police headquarters.</p>
        <p>While the artworks were relocated, the building's distinctive architecture and prominent location in the heart of the city remain. This unique facility provides the RPD with ample space for operations, training, and administration, allowing us to serve the public more effectively. Its history as a cultural institution is embraced as part of the city's unique character, repurposed to house those dedicated to protecting its citizens. </p>
